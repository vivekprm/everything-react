# What is React
Frontend javascript library created by facebook.

According to builtwith.com there are 7 million websites that use React.

# React Component Model
At the core of the react is component model that you as a Javascript Developer, create and update. As updates are made to the component model in Javascript, the user's browser is instantly updated.

As a developer we typically think of a collection of components as a tree. All react apps have a single component at the top of that tree that we refer to as the root component of our app.

All components can have 0, 1 or more children. What makes React apps both intuitive to program, as well as hugely performant is that inside components in our component tree, we trigger JavaScript events that can update one or more components anywhere in that tree.

Following that React Engine, blazingly fast, updates the browser UI to reflect the new updated component tree.
